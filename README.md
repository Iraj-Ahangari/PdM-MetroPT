Predictive Maintenance Insights: Analyzing MetroPT Data with Machine Learning

# Predictive Maintenance: MetroPT Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance (PdM) using the MetroPT dataset, sourced from the Porto metro system. The goal is to analyze sensor data to predict equipment failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and ensure operational efficiency and safety in urban metro systems.

## Dataset
The MetroPT dataset contains detailed sensor readings from the Air Production Unit (APU) of a metro train. It includes various analog and digital sensors that provide critical insights into the day-to-day operations and health of the metro system's critical components.

## Objectives
- **Early Failure Detection**: Predict equipment failures before they occur using machine learning techniques.
- **Maintenance Optimization**: Schedule maintenance activities efficiently to prevent both premature and overdue interventions.
- **Operational Excellence**: Maintain high reliability and safety standards for commuters by continuously monitoring the health of the metro system.

## Methodology
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis of sensor readings.
- Labeling data for imminent failures.
- Training a predictive model using XGBoost with GPU acceleration.
- Evaluating model performance with custom cross-validation techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- XGBoost for model training
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
